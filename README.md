# Programming Feedback for Advanced Beginners

Since the summer of 2018 I've been offering [office hours](https://robertheaton.com) in which I talk with “advanced beginner” programmers about how to get better at programming. Almost everyone I've spoken to has said that one of the biggest challenges they face is that they don't have anyone to give them feedback on their code.

To solve this problem I'm offering to review and give feedback on anybody’s code, for free, and publish the results here. [Here’s the first edition](https://robertheaton.com/pfab0). For specific, real-world ways to make your code cleaner and more professional, [subscribe now](https://advancedbeginners.substack.com).
